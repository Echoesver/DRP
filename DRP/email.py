"""
Convenience code for sending emails.

These Email below are designed to make emailing the admins (us),
the lab heads, and the lab members easier. Each takes a subject and a
message (and a lab/user if applicable), and sends them an email. If a
critical error occurs (which probably means the darkreactions email/pass
is incorrect), an uncaptured exception occurs. Each automatic "worker" process that
is added should include emails to admins to indicate failures.
